# AC-Switch-Availability
Python Script to check on the availability of the animal crossing switch


**This code checks the bestbuy website specifically. **

Its an old code I wrote while the animal crossing edition of the switch was available for preorder but is slightly updated and will check if the "add to cart button is available"

The script uses a random sleep time in between pings and a fake header to imitate a request from a firefox browser. 
The random sleep time is so the server wont see the consistant pinging as a ddos attack/bot.
